<p>
I don't say this enough,but u mean more to me than i could ever explain.
U came into my life so unexpectedly…,
I’m so grateful for you… for your kindness, your patience,  
and the love you give without even trying.
And honestly, I love the little things about us — our random talks, silly laughs, 
and the way you always make my day better without even trying. 
I’m really lucky to have you, and I hope I can make you feel just as happy as you make me.
Just stay the same, because that’s the version of you I like the most.

Being with you feels like home, and choosing you  
will always feel easy.  

So today, and every day after,  
I choose you. 💖  
</p>

<h3>Happy Valentine’s Day 💝</h3>
<p><i>Always yours ❤️</i></p>
